EduRank: A Collaborative Filtering Approach to
Personalization in E-learning

This Project includes a full implementation of the EduRank algorithm proposed by Avi Segal, Ziv Katzir, Ya’akov (Kobi) Gal, Guy Shani and Bracha Shapira.

ABSTRACT
The growing prevalence of e-learning systems and on-line courses
has made educational material widely accessible to students of varying abilities, backgrounds and styles. There is thus a growing need
to accomodate for individual differences in such e-learning systems. This paper presents a new algorithm for personliazing educational content to students that combines collaborative filtering algorithms with social choice theory. The algorithm constructs a “difficulty” ranking over questions for a target student by aggregating
the ranking of similar students, as measured by different aspects of
their performance on common past questions, such as grades, number of retries, and time spent solving questions. It infers a difficulty
ranking directly over the questions for a target student, rather than
ordering them according to predicted performance, which is prone
to error. The algorithm was tested on two large real world data sets
containing tens of thousands of students and a million records. Its
performance was compared to a variety of personalization methods
as well as a non-personalized method that relied on a domain expert. It was able to significantly outperform all of these approaches
according to standard information retrieval metrics. Our approach
can potentially be used to support teachers in tailoring problem sets
and exams to individual students and students in informing them
about areas they may need to strengthen.
